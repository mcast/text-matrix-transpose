# text-matrix-transpose

Aims.

0. Do it in Python.
1. Transpose a matrix of space-separated cells (numbers, words, whatever)
   stored in a file.
2. Do not assume that even one row of this file will fit in memory.


Why?
* To [learn Python in the local user group](https://github.com/pynxton)
* Because an [interesting problem](http://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/64370/transpose-a-large-matrix-in-python3) presented.
* [Extrinsic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate_brownie) [rewards](http://www.lego.com).  Thanks!

## Caveats

* It's not really my first Python program - I have poked Python code several times, just a little bit.
* It's also not mine, because it was Tommy's when I started.
* Testing has been ad-hoc, and is not automated.
* Performance measurements I made were mostly before/after some
  change, so are not absolute, objective or recorded anywhere.  The
  history is in the source.
